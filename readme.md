#### Brewery Prediction System

This program allows a user to simulate the current state of a brewhouse, then use previous sales data to get recommendations of the next action to take. These can include suggestions regarding which beer to brew next and if a brew should be moved into another tank.

##### How to use:

1. Set up the system to represent the current status of your brewhouse (this can be done by entering data using the text boxes and selectors, then press buttons to add to the system.)

2. Add your previous sales data to the system (press the 'Choose File' button, select the file, then click 'Append File')
3. Get your recommendations using the 'Get Recommendations' button.

If something goes wrong or you enter something incorrectly, you can always press the 'Reset System Files' button. This will mean you have to re-enter your data but should enable the system to work again.
